| **Update 1 1/31/25** | This week, I created the initial repositories for this semester and set up my local environment. I updated our README to reflect the troubleshooting process for setting up a local environment and our current team members/project state. As a minor test, I made a few cosmetic changes to our menu in order to improve ease of navigation. | I got to learning the codebase and implemented the forward and backwards reasoning tools. Since this project has no returning students we spent the majority of the time trying to figure out where the previous group left off. After going through the code I was able to fix an error in the forward and backwards reasoning tools by sending the input to the backend which while didn't return the proper output was a step towards getting it. | We downloaded and got the program running from where the last group left off. Doing this we found the process is very tedious, complicated, and slow, especially for first time users and users who havent taken operating systems, which is most PSoft students. Once we got it running, we tested which features worked, needed improvement, and weren't implemented at all. I also researched how to create a grammar, because I will need that for my next steps. | I'll include what I did last week too, so here's what I've done: I worked on the project proposal with my group members, establishing a general idea of what we all want to work on as we inspected the current codebase to see what is already done, what was being worked on, and what hasn't been worked on at all. For me, I put down that I want to work on the Forward and Backward Reasoning tools, along with possibly the condition strength tool, since it seems like it would be simpler to implement. For this week, I verified that I have all dependencies for the PSoft Tools software installed on my computer, and I made sure that I can run it on my machine and begin development without much issue. After doing so, I did some surface-level testing of the current functionality to identify how things worked currently, and what doesn't work right now. It seems like the Hoare Triple and Dafny verifier tools work just fine right now, but there are improvements to stuff like UI and output readability than can be improved. As for Forward and Backward Reasoning, those tools straight up don't work at all, so those will probably be my focus in the coming weeks. |
| **Update 2 2/07/25** | This week, the focus was on updating and improving documentation as well as planning. I created a living document to track status updates and plans for the whole group across the semester, so that onboarding will be easier in future semesters. Additionally, I did further research and planning into creating a grammar for hoare triples to be used as backend support for several of our tools. While planning, I was able to identify a few changes that will need to be made to the current interface to accommodate the changes we're making to the tools. The frontend reasoning page, for example, will need to be updated to have unique pages for solving, verifying solutions, and generation. I'm thinking that this is best done using a sidebar as seen on the design patterns page. The grammar component will likely be done in python. |  | I brainstormed possibly ways to implement daphny for forward and backwards reasoning, there is a way to make sure that the hoare triples work and I want to see if I can reuse some of that code for the reasoning. I also reviewed creating a language for hoare triple. Lastly I familiarized myself with more PSoft material as I am still taking the course. | This week was tough, so I didn’t submit a status report, but I’ve pretty much just been reading through the project’s code and familiarizing myself with the structure of each component while teaching myself things about React, CSS, Typescript, etc. |
| **Update 3 2/14/25** | This week, I made some changes to the UI. As we will need separate pages for problem generation, problem solving, and solution verification of forwards and backwards reasoning, I added side menus to those pages to navigate to each of these. I also started to create a rudimentary hoare triple grammar, but this currently only identifies singular hoare triples and not hoare triples in sequence. | This week was a much slower week since I had a lot of work piling up, I didn’t do any of my bigger projects that I planned on achieving. Instead I spent most of my time cleaning up leftover comments throughout the codebase. I also implemented a sidebar for the Hoare Triples page to prepare for our implementation of generating problems and solutions. | I built a grammar in Python for Hoare Triples. I then used the grammar to develop a generator to create random Hoare Triples. It creates valid and invalid Hoare Triples, which is what we planned on making. The generator uses recursion to generate conditions and lines of code, made up of expressions, which are made of terms, factors, variables, and numbers. | This week, I shifted my focus over to the Design Patterns section of the project, since I don't think I can really do much about our other functionality until the other members figure out about making and integrating a grammar to help process Hoare Triples into Dafny Code. Since I've never done front-end in a substantial manner before, working on the web pages for Design Patterns is a trial-by-fire, learn as I go kind of process, where I'm teaching myself CSS, HTML, and TypeScript all at once. For now, I've been focusing on changing the text formatting to look more pleasant and organized, while also touching up on some of the information and grammar within the descriptions of each design pattern. My work so far hasn't amounted to more than playing with CSS and TSX files to figure out what I can and can't do, but I feel like I'm not far from being able to substantially clean up these pages. |
| **Update 4 2/21/25** | This week, I was admittedly pretty busy with other work. I did more reading into creating our grammar, and started thinking about ways we can reduce redundancy in our codebase. This led to me getting rid of a few redundant files. I also made some modifications to the grammar created by another team member. | I spent this week organizing the codebase. A lot of what was left by the previous rcos group was very messy so I took on the task of cleaning it up. I added notation for a lot of files as well as removed a lot of clutter and unused code. I also added a description for the box where you insert your dafny code for verification. |  | Rough week for me, not much done. |
| **Update 5 2/28/25** | This week, I got rid of redundant styling pages in our codebase and began work on a page for hoare triple generation. The page itself displays correctly, but it is not yet able to successfully call and display the triples generated in our python backend. I also revised styling on a few other pages. I did some work into developing our grammar further, adding a case for boolean conditions. | This week was a much slower week since I had a lot of work piling up, I didn’t do any of my bigger projects that I planned on achieving. Instead I spent most of my time cleaning up leftover comments throughout the codebase. I also implemented a sidebar for the Hoare Triples page to prepare for our implementation of generating problems and solutions. | Fine tuned generation percentages for our hoare triple generator. A stopper for recursive depth was needed to prevent excessivly long expressions, so I also implemented that. I commented all code and added full documentation for all functions in the generator. We created a template file will getter functions to pull from with all of the lists of valid characters in our hoare triples, to make creating other hoare triple programs easier. Because of the template file, I switched our generator file to use those getter functions instead of using the hard coded variables in the generator file. | The past couple of weeks have been me catching up and slowly working through some impediments I ran into regarding some strange UI design and related file structure in the project. After wrestling with a few different .css files, which I'm new to working with, I discovered why I wasn't able to change certain things about the text format and style, so I made some small revisions to improve the readability of our Design Patterns informational web pages. Additionally, I found a bunch of unused, basic web pages that corresponded to individual, specific design patterns but weren't linked to anything, so I removed those and restructured the folders containing the Design Patterns pages before consolidating them into one folder. |
| **Update 6 3/21/25** | This week, I focused on cleaning up our current code to improve its logic, as well as future planning. As problem generation is in working condition, the main focus there has become revising our problem generator to prevent any implausible or frivolous problems from being created. Specifically, I've gotten rid of issues with problems that involve dividing by zero, problems which contain functionally meaningless code (things like x \= x; plus problems which assign one value to a variable and then immediately assign a new, independent value to the variable without performing any operations in between). The next step is working on solution verification, so I have begin to look more carefully at potential avenues here. | I created a basic frontend for the hoare triple generation. I also implemented the frontend for the forwards reasoning. I created a container that lists each line of code bit by bit and has an underline for the spots to fill in as shown in practice problems. |  | The past couple of weeks have been me catching up and slowly working through some impediments I ran into regarding some strange UI design and related file structure in the project. After wrestling with a few different .css files, which I'm new to working with, I discovered why I wasn't able to change certain things about the text format and style, so I made some small revisions to improve the readability of our Design Patterns informational web pages.

| **Update 7 3/28/25** | N/A | I completed back end documentation this week. I also finished a design plan for our output. I also started cleaning up repetitive programming that was what i'm assuming copy and pasted without being checked. | I added generation of if/else statements into our hoare triple generator. It only does if statements, or if-else statements, and not if-ifelse-else statements, as we decided it would be too complex examples based off of the PSoft course content. I also fixed our forward and backward reasoning generation, as it wasn't putting spaces between every line of code for the current strongest post condition or weakest pre conditions, but now it is. | While waiting for other group members to continue working on the grammar for processing and generating problems for Hoare Triples and Forward/Backward Reasoning (which I will need to use for developing the Condition Strength tool), I continued working on some Design Patterns and then looked into the CFG creation tool. There were some strange and wonky-looking UI issues, so I fixed those and made sure the canvas for the CFG was always contained within the user's display while adhering to the bounds set by the navbar at the top of the page. Lastly, I took a look at all of the associated code with the CFG tool before commenting and reformatting the code as best I could so that the files are as readable and comprehensible as possible. |
| **Update 8 4/04/25** | This week, I have been extremely busy with an extracurricular and haven't had much time to code or plan. I've been considering how we might implement our parser for hoare triples to work with our grammar. Ideally, we should be able to take advantage of the existing dafny interpreter for original hoare triples. | I worked on documenting the backend repository of our code. I specifically wanted to clean up the dafny portion which was the main part of the backend and was left very unorganized. I also came up with a few ideas to clean the look of the frontend since it isn't aesthetically pleasing |  | Since our project lead was busy this week, the merging of the generation branch into main, which I expected to happen, did not take place, and due to my own business with extracurriculars, I was not able to accomplish much either. I decided to make a pull request for the ui-changes branch of our frontend, and I will wait for our project lead to review and accept that request. Additionally, I took a look at some other portions of the UI and codebase that might need touching up in terms of visuals and documentation, respectively, but nothing concrete was accomplished on that end. |
| **Update 9 4/11/25** | N/A | I am in the processing of documenting the entire backend. I was having an issue where I wouldn't be able to get the proper response from the backend due to me storing my files within onedrive so I fixed that. I also am working on another issue where I have all the working code but my formatting is different than my groupmates outputs. | Worked on brain storming how to verify forward and backward reasoning. Implemented an outline of it with most logic correct. Only thing holding it back is sending strings between files in the program, which I don't know how to do. (Sending from forwardVerifier to hoare verifier). | I created a new webpage and tab in the top navbar for the new Condition Strength tool, both for the code verifying portion as well as the practice problem generation portion. However, I have not committed the changes yet due to the main branch still not being merged with the problem generation branch which has the Python Hoare Triple grammar. I was not able to create much more documentation in the codebase due to continued mental health issues, even though that was the backup plan for this week. (I might have forgotten that I made the strength page earlier, but I saw it was untracked in my local grammar branch. So ignore that). |

## **Ideas**

* Grammar: use as basis of Hoare-triple identifying/generating  
  * Probably in python  
    * What libraries are we thinking?  
      * Trying lark
